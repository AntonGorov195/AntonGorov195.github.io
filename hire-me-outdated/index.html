            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm a 3rd year computer science <em>student</em> at <abbr><a href="https://www.hit.ac.il/">
                        <em>HIT</em>
                    </a></abbr>.
                Currently, I'm <em>looking for a job</em> in the field of software development.
                Thanks to my <em>curiosity</em> and love for <em>problem
                    solving</em>, I've
                found programming as my most beloved hobby.
                I have worked in both high level languages (JS, Java, C#, Python) and also low level languages (C, Odin)
                and I found that I derive joy from both of them.
                Because of that, I have a <em>strong foundation for understanding how software
                    works</em>.
                If you are interested in hire me <a href="#links">go to the links down below</a>.
            </p>
            <h2> You SHOULD Hire Me; No Other Will Do! </h2>
            <p>
                If you are unconvinced, here is why I am the best candidate for the job:

                        <p>
                            Code quality matters. But what is high quality code? You may ask.
                            Here are the characteristics of good code:

                                    <p>
                                        I've seen it too many times. My peers ignoring error handling and it always
                                        bites them in the ass.
                                        Error handling <strong>is not an afterthought, it is an integral part of
                                            software design.</strong> When starting a project I always ask myself how
                                        would I handle errors. Not once I came to the conclusion that designing with
                                        error handling was a mistake.

                                    <p>
                                        In the world of programming, there are so many tools at your disposal. Version
                                        control (git), dev tools, debuggers, hot reloading should be part of your
                                        workflow.
                                        These tools should be mastered, and used to the fullest extent. One of my gripes
                                        in university is that we never went deep into this subject (besides git).
                                        However, I value their power and ready to use them as nessasary.

                                    <summary> Written With Tests in Mind </summary>
                                    <p>
                                        Writing test at the start of the project can be rough. Due to constantly
                                        changing requirements, the test may quickly become obsolete. However, if the
                                        code
                                        was written improperly, it can be tough to write them.
                                        The right way to code is to have a clear strategy when it comes to tests.
                                        Sometimes, writing tests can be straightforward.

                        <p>
                            I find documenting code not just helps me in the future, but also helps me to understand it
                            now. Writing readable code is good but not always possible. For example, I was working
                            on some physics code in one of my projects. The physics logic is not simple to understand to
                            someone who doesn't know it. Writing extra documentation in a seperate file helped me to
                            formulate my logic behind the math.
