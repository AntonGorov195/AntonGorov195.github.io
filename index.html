            <p>
                Hi, my name is <strong>Anton Gorov</strong> and this is my personal page.
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>About me</summary>
                <div style="padding-left: 1rem;">
                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm a recent graduate from HIT university and a proud lover of programming.
                        My journey started back in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> game rngine 5.4 (2016).
                        This was a great time.
                        But my joy came from programming, not the games themselves.
                        It wasn't about creating things, it was about solving problems.
                        It was my love for learning and a deep sense of curiosity which lead my here.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        However, as a game engine, it enforced a specific workflow.
                        It wasn't a bad one per say, but I wanted more.
                        So of course, I wanted to know why it worked the way it did.
                        This is how most people focused on the surface level things.
                        This kinda makes sense considering Unity is closed source.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        One thing I did see are discussions around raw pointers.
                        How the are scary and cause so many bugs and such.
                        So naturally I dug deeper.
                        This is how I learn about manual memory existing, virtual memory, function pointers.
                        At that point I still didn't dare to venture away from Unity.
                        I tried <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> but it wasn't all too different from Unity.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Time has passed.
                        I begun going to university.
                        I met great people; learned a lot of new things.
                        It is hard for me to construct a timeline due to how many new things I was learning at once.
                        Of course, it was more than the courses.
                        I programmed small experiments at home.
                        I discovered new ways to programs.
                        New paradigms uncovered.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Now I'm here.
                        I've on a long journey to get here.
                        Now I'm looking for job opportunities.
