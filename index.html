                    I'm a student at <a href="https://www.hit.ac.il/">Holon Institute of Technology(a.k.a HIT)</a>.
                    It all started when my brother showed me the Unity game engine,
                    and from that point one I've been programming ever since.

                    One of my first projects was a small video game called <a href="https://github.com/AntonGorov195/Wall2Wall">Wall2Wall</a>. A tiny game I wrote in over
                    the weekend in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> programming language. The Goal of the game is to bounce
                    the ball from one wall to the other by shooting smaller balls at it.

                    Another project I made was <a href="https://github.com/AntonGorov195/EduHITZone">HITEduZone</a>. This
                    is a website for hosting video courses and has an AI assistant to help summeries. This
                    project originated by HIT's request. In that project I used <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> programming language and <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>.

                    While I started programming with Unity, I later expanded my horizon.
                    I dabbled in web frontend/backend, game programming, cli tooling and making programming languages.
                    Each one of these taught me something new and enriched love for programming.

                    My favourite part of programming is the problem solving.
                    Coming up with clever solutions for new problem or
                    refactoring code to make it mode readable brings me joy.
