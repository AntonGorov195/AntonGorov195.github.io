                <p>
                    Hi, I'm a recent graduate from HIT university and a proud lover of programming.
                    My journey started back in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> game rngine 5.4 (2016).
                    This was a great time.
                    But my joy came from programming, not the games themselves.
                    It wasn't about creating things, it was about solving problems.
                    It was my love for learning and a deep sense of curiosity which lead my here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as a game engine, it enforced a specific workflow.
                    It wasn't a bad one per say, but I wanted more.
                    So of course, I wanted to know why it worked the way it did.
                    This is how most people focused on the surface level things.
                    This kinda makes sense considering Unity is closed source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing I did see are discussions around raw pointers.
                    How the are scary and cause so many bugs and such.
                    So naturally I dug deeper.
                    This is how I learn about manual memory existing, virtual memory, function pointers.
                    At that point I still didn't dare to venture away from Unity.
                    I tried <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> but it wasn't all too different from Unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time has passed.
                    I begun going to university.
                    I met great people; learned a lot of new things.
                    It is hard for me to construct a timeline due to how many new things I was learning at once.
                    Of course, it was more than the courses.
                    I programmed small experiments at home.
                    I discovered new ways to programs.
                    New paradigms uncovered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm here.
                    I've on a long journey to get here.
                    Now I'm looking for job opportunities.

                    I value writing high quality code.
                    To me, by accepting my job as a programmer, I take the duty of delivering my best.
                    However, what is good code anyway?
                    While I still have a long way to go, I have standarts.
                    <strong>I'm confident the folowing things are necessary for a high quality codebase.</strong>

                            <p>
                                A punny statement for sure.
                                But what does it mean?
                                Let's look at a simple pseudo code example.
                            </p>
                            <code>
                                <pre>
    function execute(path: string) -> Value {
        let script = lang.load(path);
        let tokens = lang.tokenize(script);
        let ast = lang.buildAst(tokens);
        let output = lang.eval(ast);
        script.free();
        return output;
    }
                                </pre>
                            </code>
                            <p>
                                In this example, we have a function for executing a script.
                                What you don't see are all the possible errors that may occur.
                                <code>load</code> may throw and exeption if the script wasn't found.
                                <code>tokenize</code> may throw if it contained an invalid character.
                                <code>buildAst</code> may throw if it contained an unexpected token.
                                <code>evalScript</code> may throw if the code contained a runtime error.
                                Yet, there is no clear way to see this unless you are aware of the internal details of
                                how it works.
                                This obviously break encapsulation from my point of view and thus a bad design.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While you can use a try-catch to handle the error, this wouldn't fix the lack of
                                encapsulation.
                                The core problem stems from the idea errors shouldn't be part of an API.
                                This view states that errors are an exceptional cases, and thus should be treated
                                differently than other code.
                                "Errors are Valid, No Exceptions" is about how errors should be considered a valid and
                                expected state.
                                Let's take a look at code that adheres to this principle:
                            </p>
                            <code>
                                <pre>
    function execute(path: string) -> (Value, error) {
        let script, err = lang.load(path);
        if err != null {
            return null, "failed loading script\n" + err;
        }
        defer script.free();
        let tokens, err = lang.tokenize(script);
        if err != null {
            return null, "failed tokenizing script\n" + err;
        }
        let ast, err = lang.buildAst(tokens);
        if err != null {
            return null, "failed building an ast\n" + err
        }
        let output, err = lang.eval(ast);
        if err != null {
            return null, "failed evaluating script" + err
        }
        return output, null;
    }
                                </pre>
                            </code>
                            <p>
                                This is code which adheres to Errors are Valid principle.
                                Here the error is a part of the function's signature, and thus is not longer an implementation detail.
                                If you used the Go programming language then this would look familiar to you.
                                Go uses errors as values which are integral part of errors being treated as a valid state
