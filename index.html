            <p> 
                I'm a student at Holon Institute of Technology(a.k.a HIT).
                It all started when my brother showed me the Unity game engine, 
                and from that point one I've been programming ever since.

            <p> 
                While I started programming with Unity, I later expanded my horizon.
                I dabbled in web frontend/backend, game programming, cli tooling and making programming languages.
                Each one of these taught me something new and enriched love for programming.

            <p> 
                My favourite part of programming is the puzzle solving. 
                Coming up with clever solutions for new problem or 
                refactoring code to make it mode readable brings me joy.
