                Hi, my name is <strong>Anton Gorov</strong> and this is my personal page.

                <p>
                    Hi, I'm a recent graduate from HIT university and a proud lover of programming.
                    My journey started back in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> game rngine 5.4 (2016).
                    This was a great time.
                    But my joy came from programming, not the games themselves.
                    It wasn't about creating things, it was about solving problems.
                    It was my love for learning and a deep sense of curiosity which lead my here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as a game engine, it enforced a specific workflow.
                    It wasn't a bad one per say, but I wanted more.
                    So of course, I wanted to know why it worked the way it did.
                    This is how most people focused on the surface level things.
                    This kinda makes sense considering Unity is closed source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing I did see are discussions around raw pointers.
                    How the are scary and cause so many bugs and such.
                    So naturally I dug deeper.
                    This is how I learn about manual memory existing, virtual memory, function pointers.
                    At that point I still didn't dare to venture away from Unity.
                    I tried <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> but it wasn't all too different from Unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time has passed.
                    I begun going to university.
                    I met great people; learned a lot of new things.
                    It is hard for me to construct a timeline due to how many new things I was learning at once.
                    Of course, it was more than the courses.
                    I programmed small experiments at home.
                    I discovered new ways to programs.
                    New paradigms uncovered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm here.
                    I've on a long journey to get here.
                    Now I'm looking for job opportunities.
