        <h2> What is Inheritance </h2>
        <p>
            The Wikipidia definition is:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)">
                <q>In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon
                    another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar
                    implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones such as super
                    class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes...</q>
