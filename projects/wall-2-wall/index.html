        <h2> Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a simple game about bouncing the ball from one wall to the other.
            Each time the main ball(red) hits a green wall, your score goes up.
            However, if the ball falls out of the game window, you lose.
            To keep the ball afloat you shoot other balls at it to maintain it up in the air.
        </p>
        <h2> What I learned from this </h2>
        <p>
            The most interesting thing I learned in this project is physics.
            More precisely, elastic collision between two dimensional circles.
            I combined my mathematical skills and problem solving skill to accomplish this.
            At first I tried a more simple approach.
        </p>
        <h2> Things I know about One dimensional Newtonian collision</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> The mass of the object doesn't matter, only the ratio. </li>
            <li> Relativity </li>
            <li> If fisrt ball has a much larger mass than the second, collision will have minimal impact on the second.</li>
            <li> If the two ball have same mass, they will swich their velicities. </li>
            <li> If fisrt ball has a much smaller mass than the second, it will bounce off the second ball</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This all means that instead of looking at the masses and velocity, we'll look at the mass ratio and relative velocity.
